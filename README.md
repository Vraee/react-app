A nonspecific React app that retrieves data from Steam API.

The app has a simple text box filtering data. Since there are so many apps, information
is displayed only when there are hundred matches or less. If there are ten or less
matches, short summaries of the apps are also displayed. Clicking a listed app shows a
more comprehensive description when available.
